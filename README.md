## Hello fellow learners! ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal learning repository, a space where I dive into the exciting world of new programming languages and libraries. Feel free to explore and learn along with me!

## YouTube Video Summarizer
Check out the YouTube Video Summarizer project in the Projects directory. This Python script extracts and summarizes information from a YouTube video using various libraries.

If you have suggestions or improvements, I'm open to contributions. Happy coding and learning! ðŸš€
